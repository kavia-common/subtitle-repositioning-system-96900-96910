"""
Core logic for subtitle repositioning.

This module defines a public interface that will be fulfilled by the algorithm
in attachments/reposition_subtitles7.py. If/when that file is provided, the
logic here should be replaced or delegated to that implementation.

The current implementation is a deterministic placeholder that preserves the
subtitle content and timing while toggling between 'bottom' and 'top' positions
in a simple manner. This is only to allow API integration and end-to-end wiring.

    """
    Reposition subtitles to avoid overlap with burnt-in text for a given video.

    Parameters:
        video_path: Path to the uploaded video file on disk. The algorithm may
                    extract frames or metadata from this file. Current stub does
                    not use it but the final implementation should.
        subtitles: List of (start_seconds, end_seconds, text) tuples parsed from
                   the provided subtitle file.

    Returns:
        A list of (start_seconds, end_seconds, text, position) tuples where
        position is a string hint such as 'top' or 'bottom'. Final production
        code may include pixel coordinates or detailed styling; this API can be
        extended with a Pydantic model if needed.

    Notes:
        - This is a placeholder implementation to allow API endpoints to be
          functional before integrating the real algorithm from
          reposition_subtitles7.py.
